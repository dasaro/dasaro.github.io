  "teaching_philosophy": "From my first appointments as a BSc student to the present, I have taught every year without interruption across Philosophy, Information Studies, and Computer/Data Science programs. I design and deliver courses for diverse cohorts along two axesâ€“expertise (from non-specialists to experts) and academic level (pre-BSc through PhD and postdoc). Student evaluations have been consistently strong, with my courses frequently among the highest-rated in their cohorts. My teaching spans Logic, Philosophy of Science, Logic Programming, Computer Programming, Applied and Theoretical Computer Science. I also place a strong emphasis on supervision and mentoring, with consistently excellent outcomes across theses and projects, evidenced by external recognition, publications, and open research outputs.",
