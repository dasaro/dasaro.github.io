      "I believe in hands-on learning that combines rigorous theoretical foundations with practical applications. My teaching emphasizes critical thinking, formal reasoning, and the development of computational skills that prepare students for both academic research and industry careers.",
      "I strive to make abstract concepts concrete through examples, interactive demonstrations, and real-world applications. Students learn best when they can connect formal theories to practical problems and see the relevance of logic and AI in modern technology.",
      "My approach encourages active participation, collaborative problem-solving, and independent exploration. I aim to foster curiosity and equip students with tools for lifelong learning in rapidly evolving fields."
