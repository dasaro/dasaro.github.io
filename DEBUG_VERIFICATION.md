## ✅ Publications Data Structure Verification

### publications.json Structure
```json
{
  "selected": [8 publications],  ✓ Array exists
  "all": [17 publications]       ✓ Array exists
}
```

### Publication Object Structure (sample from pub_2025_graphical)
```json
{

- `./data/education.json` ✓
- `./data/experience.json` ✓
- `./data/publications.json` ✓
- `./data/teaching.json` ✓
- `./data/projects.json` ✓

## ✅ Author Name Highlighting

### Regex Pattern Check
```javascript
// CORRECT (Global flag for multiple occurrences)
authors.replace(/F\. A\. D'Asaro/g, "<strong>F. A. D'Asaro</strong>");

## 🧪 Next Step: Browser Testing

### To test the site:

1. **Start a local server:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/fdasaro/Desktop/dasaro.github.io
   python3 -m http.server 8000
   ```

2. **Open browser:**
   - Navigate to `http://localhost:8000`

3. **Open browser console:**
   - Chrome/Edge: `F12` or `Cmd+Option+I` (Mac)
   - Firefox: `F12` or `Cmd+Option+K` (Mac)
   - Safari: `Cmd+Option+C` (enable Developer menu first)

4. **Check console output:**
   - Look for the messages listed above
   - Verify no errors appear
   - Check that publications are displayed on the page

5. **Test other pages:**
   - Navigate to About page
   - Navigate to Publications page
   - Check console for proper loading messages

---

## Expected Behavior

### ✅ If Working Correctly:
- Home page displays 3 recent publications with titles, authors, venues
- Scholar metrics show: 227 citations, h-index 10, i10-index 10
- No "Loading..." messages remain on screen
- Console shows successful load messages
- No JavaScript errors

### ❌ If Still Not Working:
Report exactly which console messages appear and where the process stops. This will help identify:
- Network issues (fetch failures)
- CORS issues (if using file:// protocol)
- Data parsing errors
- DOM element not found errors
