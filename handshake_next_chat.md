# Handshake for Next Chat: dasaro.github.io Development

## Project Overview

**Website:** Academic personal website for Fabio Aurelio D'Asaro (dasaro.github.io)  
**Owner:** Logician and AI researcher working at University of Salento, University of Verona, and UCL  
**Tech Stack:** Pure HTML/CSS/JavaScript (no frameworks), JSON-driven content, GitHub Pages hosting  
**Design Philosophy:** "Hacker-meets-Philosopher" with terminal aesthetics and red-on-white color scheme

---

## Current Status

✅ **Completed:**
- Home, About, Publications, Teaching, Projects, Service, Contact pages
- JSON data files populated with CV content
- Navigation system with toggle button
- 8 background animations (see below)
- Responsive design
- All content from CV integrated

⚠️ **Current Issue:**
- **Game of Life animation is glitching/not working**
- Animations may have stopped working after recent fixes
- Need to diagnose and fix the Game of Life specifically

---

## Background Animations System

Located in: `js/animations.js`

### Architecture:
```javascript
class BackgroundAnimations {
    animations: {
        gameOfLife: ...,      // ⚠️ BROKEN - needs fix
        fibonacci: ...,       // ✅ Working
        primes: ...,          // ✅ Working
        riemann: ...,         // ✅ Working
        mandelbrot: ...,      // ✅ Working (inner boundary only)
        proofTree: ...,       // ✅ Working
        pacman: ...,          // ✅ Working
        rule30: ...           // ✅ Working (newest addition)
    }
}
```

### Animation Details:

1. **Game of Life** ⚠️ CURRENTLY BROKEN
   - Conway's cellular automaton
   - Should display subtle red circles (opacity 0.15-0.08)
   - Updates every 8 frames
   - 12px cell size
   - Reseeds every 400 frames to prevent extinction
   - **Problem:** Glitching or not displaying

2. **Fibonacci Spiral** ✅
   - Golden ratio spiral
   - Dark red (#8B0000), slowly rotating

3. **Prime Spiral** ✅
   - Ulam's prime number pattern
   - Red dots with gradient glow

4. **Riemann Zeta** ✅
   - Subtle (0.25 opacity)
   - Critical line visualization

5. **Mandelbrot Set** ✅
   - Only inner boundary visible (not exterior)
   - Shows outline of set in subtle red (0.35 opacity)
   - Pixel-perfect rendering with blur filter

6. **Proof Tree** ✅
   - Logic inference tree
   - Builds over 300 frames
   - Red connections and nodes

7. **Pac-Man** ✅
   - Classic arcade game
   - Size 35, speed 2.5
   - NO PELLETS (avoid trypophobia)

8. **Rule 30** ✅ RECENTLY ADDED
   - Wolfram's cellular automaton
   - Classic square cells (8px)
   - Red-to-gray fade effect:
     - Age 0-5: Bright red (emphasis on new growth)
     - Age 5-15: Fading to gray
     - Age 15+: Very light gray (subtle)
   - Cascades top to bottom, restarts cleanly

### Animation Selection:
- Random on page load
- Toggle button cycles through all 8
- Preference saved in localStorage
- Keyboard shortcut: 'A' key

---

## Color Scheme (IMPORTANT)

**Background:** Pure white (#FFFFFF)  
**Primary accent:** Dark red (#8B0000)  
**Text:** Black (#000000)  
**Animations:** Red gradient/glow effects on white

**Philosophy:** Less invasive, subtle, academic aesthetic

---

## Key Design Decisions

1. **No dense dot patterns** (avoid trypophobia)
2. **Subtle animations** (0.15-0.4 opacity typically)
3. **Classic/academic look** (Wolfram-style cubes, clean lines)
4. **Red-to-gray fading** (emphasize new elements, old fade away)
5. **Smooth/vectorial appearance** (not pixelated where possible)

---

## Game of Life - What It Should Look Like

### Correct Behavior:
```javascript
- Grid: 12px cells
- Display: Small red circles (cellSize / 3 radius)
- Color: Radial gradient
  - Center: rgba(139, 0, 0, 0.15)
  - Edge: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)
- Updates: Every 8 frames
- Rules: Standard Conway's Life
- Reseeding: Every 400 frames (5 random cells)
- Initial density: 15% alive
```

### What Was Breaking:
- Canvas not clearing properly between animation switches
- Grid initialization issues with Array.fill().map()
- Context validation problems
- Animation not stopping cleanly

### Previous Attempted Fixes (may have made it worse):
- Added try-catch blocks
- Added defensive checks
- Added framerate limiting
- Improved stop() method

## Immediate Task: Fix Game of Life

### Symptoms:
- "Game of life still glitching" (user screenshot)
- May show artifacts
- May not display at all
- Other animations may have stopped working after recent fixes

### What to Check:
1. Is the canvas element present in HTML?
2. Is the context valid when gameOfLife() is called?
3. Is the grid initialization working?
4. Are there console errors?
5. Is the animation loop running?
6. Is the stop() method interfering?

### Debugging Approach:
1. First, verify the canvas exists and has context
2. Simplify gameOfLife() to minimal working version
3. Add console.log statements to trace execution
4. Test in browser console
5. Verify stop() method isn't breaking things

### Key Code Location:
- File: `js/animations.js`
- Method: `gameOfLife()` (around line 150-250)
- Also check: `stop()` method (around line 140)
- Also check: `start()` method (around line 130)

---

## Testing Protocol

After any fix:
1. Open site in browser
2. Open console (F12)
3. Check for errors
4. Toggle animations multiple times
5. Specifically test Game of Life
6. Verify smooth transitions
7. Test on page reload

---

## Important Context from This Chat

### What Worked Well:
- Rule 30 implementation (red-to-gray fade)
- Mandelbrot inner boundary only
- Classic Wolfram aesthetic
- Animation rotation system

### What Went Wrong:
- Attempted to make Game of Life more robust
- Added too many defensive checks
- May have broken the basic functionality
- Need to go back to simpler, working version

## Quick Reference: Working Game of Life Code

If you need a reference, here's what the SIMPLE working version should look like:

```javascript
gameOfLife() {
    const cellSize = 12;
    const cols = Math.floor(this.canvas.width / cellSize);
    const rows = Math.floor(this.canvas.height / cellSize);

    let grid = Array(rows).fill().map(() =>
        Array(cols).fill().map(() => Math.random() < 0.15 ? 1 : 0)
    );

    const countNeighbors = (x, y) => {
        let count = 0;
        for (let i = -1; i <= 1; i++) {
            for (let j = -1; j <= 1; j++) {
                if (i === 0 && j === 0) continue;
                const row = (y + i + rows) % rows;
                const col = (x + j + cols) % cols;
                count += grid[row][col];
            }
        }
        return count;
    };

    let frameCount = 0;
    const animate = () => {
        frameCount++;
        if (frameCount % 8 === 0) {
            const nextGrid = grid.map((row, y) =>
                row.map((cell, x) => {
                    const neighbors = countNeighbors(x, y);
                    return cell === 1
                        ? (neighbors === 2 || neighbors === 3 ? 1 : 0)
                        : (neighbors === 3 ? 1 : 0);
                })
            );
            grid = nextGrid;
            
            this.ctx.fillStyle = '#FFFFFF';
            this.ctx.fillRect(0, 0, this.canvas.width, this.canvas.height);
            
            for (let y = 0; y < rows; y++) {
                for (let x = 0; x < cols; x++) {
                    if (grid[y][x] === 1) {
                        const gradient = this.ctx.createRadialGradient(
                            x * cellSize + cellSize / 2,
                            y * cellSize + cellSize / 2,
                            0,
                            x * cellSize + cellSize / 2,
                            y * cellSize + cellSize / 2,
                            cellSize / 2
                        );
                        gradient.addColorStop(0, 'rgba(139, 0, 0, 0.15)');
                        gradient.addColorStop(1, 'rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08)');
                        this.ctx.fillStyle = gradient;
                        this.ctx.beginPath();
                        this.ctx.arc(
                            x * cellSize + cellSize / 2,
                            y * cellSize + cellSize / 2,
                            cellSize / 3,
                            0,
                            Math.PI * 2
                        );
                        this.ctx.fill();
                    }
                }
            }
            
            if (frameCount % 400 === 0) {
                for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
                    const x = Math.floor(Math.random() * cols);
                    const y = Math.floor(Math.random() * rows);
                    grid[y][x] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        this.animationId = requestAnimationFrame(animate);
    };
    animate();
}
```

This is the SIMPLE version that should work. Start here if debugging.

## Next Steps for You

1. **Diagnose:** Check browser console for errors in animations.js
2. **Simplify:** Try the simple Game of Life code above
3. **Test:** Verify it works with toggle button
4. **Commit:** Once working, ready to push to GitHub
5. **Deploy:** Site goes live at https://dasaro.github.io

## Contact with User

User is:
- Academic/logician at University of Verona/Salento/UCL
- Very collaborative and clear about preferences
- Appreciates step-by-step explanations
- Familiar with terminal/technical concepts
- Working directory: `/Users/fdasaro/Desktop/dasaro.github.io`

---

## Final Notes

- Keep animations SUBTLE (user emphasized "less invasive")
- Red-on-white color scheme (don't introduce other colors)
- Test every change in browser before moving on
- Game of Life should be simple, not over-engineered
- Focus on getting basic functionality working first

**Primary Goal:** Get Game of Life animation working smoothly again.

**Secondary Goal:** Ensure all 8 animations work and toggle properly.

**Tertiary Goal:** Push to GitHub once stable.

---

Good luck! The codebase is clean and well-organized. The issue is likely simple - probably over-complicated the Game of Life with too many defensive checks. Strip it back to basics and rebuild from there.
