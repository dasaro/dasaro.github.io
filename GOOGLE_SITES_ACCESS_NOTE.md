# Google Sites Content Access Note

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Task:** Extract and translate teaching content for prospective students
**Status:** Unable to access directly - manual extraction needed

---

## Issue

Cannot access https://sites.google.com/view/fdasaro directly due to OAuth authentication requirements.

## Current State

Your **dissertation-info.html** page already has:
- ✅ Comprehensive structure for prospective students
- ✅ PhD-focused content loaded from `dissertation_instructions.json`

   - Research topics (6 areas)
   - Supervision philosophy
   - Application process (4 steps)
   - Current openings status
   - PhD programs at 3 universities
   - FAQs (4 questions)

2. **Page is already professional and complete**
   - Uses JSON-driven architecture
   - Loads supervision data showing 7 successful students
   - Clear call-to-action
   - Well-styled with custom CSS

## If You Have Italian Content from Google Sites

If your Google Sites page has specific Italian text about teaching/supervision that you'd like translated and added, please:

### Option A: Share the Italian Text

Copy/paste any Italian text sections and I can:
1. Translate them accurately to English
2. Add them to the appropriate sections
3. Document the translations

### Option B: Share Screenshots

If easier, share screenshots of Italian content sections and I'll:
1. Extract the text
2. Translate it
3. Integrate it into the appropriate data files

### Option C: Describe What's Missing

If there's specific guidance on Google Sites not yet on your website, describe it and I can:
1. Create equivalent English content
2. Add it to the appropriate sections
3. Match your style and approach

I'll create professional English content based on this.
