## Automated Checks You Can Run

```bash
cd /Users/fdasaro/Desktop/dasaro.github.io/data

# Check for placeholder values
grep -n "YOUR_" *.json

# Check for empty fields
grep -n '""' *.json

# Check for null values that might need content
grep -n 'null' *.json

# Validate JSON syntax
for file in *.json; do
  echo "Checking $file..."
  python3 -m json.tool "$file" > /dev/null && echo "‚úÖ Valid" || echo "‚ùå Invalid JSON"
done

# Count publications
grep -c '"id":' publications.json

# Check for broken year formats
