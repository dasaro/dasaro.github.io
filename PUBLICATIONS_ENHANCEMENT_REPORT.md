### 2. Publications in "Selected" with Missing PDFs

Your **showcase publications** that should have links:

| ID | Title | Year | Venue | Has PDF? | Has DOI? | Priority |
|----|-------|------|-------|----------|----------|----------|
| pub_2025_graphical | Graphical Formalism | 2025 | JAIR | ‚ùå | ‚úÖ | üî¥ HIGH |

## 4. Specific Action Items

### üî¥ CRITICAL (Do First)

**Fix Inconsistency:**
1. **pub_2025_trustworthiness** - Has arXiv PDF in "all" but not in "selected"
   - Copy `"pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12934"` to "selected" entry

**Add Open Access PDFs:**
2. **pub_2025_graphical** (JAIR 2025)
   - Visit: https://doi.org/10.1613/jair.1.18606
   - Find PDF link on JAIR site
   - Add to JSON

3. **pub_2022_xai_special_issue** (Frontiers 2022)
   - Visit: https://doi.org/10.3389/frai.2022.970246
   - Frontiers always has "Download PDF" button
   - Add direct PDF link

4. **pub_2020_kr_ilp** (KR 2020)
   - Check: https://proceedings.kr.org/2020/
   - Find paper number/URL
   - Add PDF link

### üü° MEDIUM PRIORITY

**Check for arXiv versions:**
5. **pub_2020_aij** - "Probabilistic Reasoning About Epistemic Action Narratives" (AIJ)
   - Core PhD paper - likely has arXiv version
   - Search: arXiv for "D'Asaro probabilistic epistemic action"

6. **pub_2024_asp_epistemic** (IJAR 2024)
   - Recent journal paper - may have arXiv version
   - Search arXiv

7. **pub_2023_ehealth** (TPLP 2023)
   - Check for author version or arXiv

**Conference Proceedings PDFs:**
8. **pub_2017_lpnmr** - "Foundations for PEC"
   - LPNMR proceedings published by Springer
   - Likely DOI exists: Check Springer LNCS series
   - May have author version available

### üü¢ LOW PRIORITY

**Workshop/Other Papers:**
- Most workshop papers (BEWARE series, WOA, etc.) - check author versions
- Older papers (2013-2015) - lower priority unless featured
- Book chapter (2014) - unlikely to have free PDF

## 5. How to Add PDFs and DOIs

### For Open Access Journal Papers:

**JAIR Example:**
```json
"pdf": "https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/XXXXX/XXXXX"
```

**Frontiers Example:**
```json
"pdf": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frai.2022.970246/pdf"
```

### For arXiv Papers:

```json
"pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/YYMM.NNNNN",
"arxiv": "YYMM.NNNNN"
```

### For Conference Proceedings:

**KR Proceedings:**
```json
"pdf": "https://proceedings.kr.org/YYYY/NN/krYYYY-00NN-author-et-al.pdf"
```

**Springer LNCS:**
```json
"doi": "10.1007/978-X-XXX-XXXXX-X_NN",
"url": "https://doi.org/10.1007/978-X-XXX-XXXXX-X_NN"
```

## 6. Quick Fixes You Can Do Now

### Fix #1: Sync trustworthiness paper

**File:** data/publications.json
**Line:** ~19-32 (in "selected" array)

**Change:**
```json
"pdf": null,
```

**To:**
```json
"pdf": "https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.12934",
```

### Fix #2: Add missing open_access flag

In "all" array, `pub_2025_trustworthiness` (line ~191-204) has PDF but check if it should be:
```json
"open_access": true,
```

## 9. What I Can Help With

**Provide me with any of the following and I'll update the JSON:**

1. **PDF URLs** - Just say: "pub_2025_graphical PDF is https://..."
2. **DOI numbers** - Say: "pub_2017_lpnmr DOI is 10.xxxx/xxxxx"
3. **arXiv IDs** - Say: "pub_2020_aij arXiv is 2001.12345"
4. **Multiple at once** - List them and I'll batch update

**Or tell me:**
- "Check Google Sites for PDF links" - I'll guide you through copying them
- "Update the trustworthiness paper" - I'll fix the inconsistency immediately
- "Skip workshop papers" - I'll focus only on journals/conferences

## 10. Estimated Impact

### If we add PDFs to open access papers (3-5 papers):
- ‚úÖ Users can read your work directly from your site
- ‚úÖ Increases engagement and citations
- ‚úÖ Professional presentation

### If we add arXiv links to selected papers (5-8 papers):
- ‚úÖ Makes flagship research freely accessible
- ‚úÖ Aligns with open science practices
- ‚úÖ Broader reach

### If we add missing DOIs (10-15 papers):
- ‚úÖ Proper scholarly attribution
- ‚úÖ Better metadata for indexing
- ‚úÖ Professional completeness

## Next Steps

**Option A: Quick Wins (15 minutes)**
1. Fix trustworthiness PDF inconsistency
2. Add JAIR and Frontiers PDFs (just visit the DOI links)
3. Commit and deploy

**Option B: Comprehensive (2-3 hours)**
1. Check Google Sites for any PDFs you've already listed there
2. Search arXiv for your key papers
3. Check conference proceedings websites
4. Systematically go through the checklist above

**Option C: Guided Approach**
1. Tell me which papers are most important to you
2. I'll create a focused list for just those
3. We do those first, skip the rest
